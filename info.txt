This program has the sole purpose of merging and/or compressing multiple PDFs.  It uses the pypdf2 module for the merging and compressing. The GUI was created using the 
tkinter module. When you open this application, you are presented with a textbox and two buttons(?). You have the option of giving the final merged PDF a name, 
which defaults to Merged.pdf(?) if you choose not to give it a name. You can only choose PDF files from the same folder, 
and after selecting them, you are allowed to save your merged PDF in any directory that you desire. Make sure to select the files in order.
